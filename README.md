# CNN-for-Image-Classification

Handwritten digit classification is a well-studied problem in computer vision. In this project, we are
tasked with classifying images containing digits from an unknown language along with QMNIST
characters. Each image contains one target digit from the unknown language, which we are required
to identify among ten possible classes. This mini-project presents an opportunity to develop and
evaluate a machine learning pipeline for supervised image classification using Python and PyTorch.
The dataset presents challenges such as mixed character presence, potentially noisy backgrounds, and
unknown digit styles, requiring the model to learn robust, discriminative features. To tackle this, we
explore several neural network architectures, namely convolutional neural networks (CNNs), known
for their success in visual recognition tasks. We also investigate various training techniques like batch
normalization and dropout to enhance generalization.

Our final solution is selected based on validation accuracy and leaderboard performance. Throughout
this report, we discuss our design decisions, evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different
models, and provide insights into what contributed to our best-performing solution.
